    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Good old fried rice. As Uncle Roger put it, it's a very simple dish consisting of nothing more than "egg, fried and rice". I grew up eating it along the streets of Indonesia, and even now in Singapore, I find myself coming back to this stupidly delicious comfort food on a weekly basis. There's not much to learn about it: all you need to know is the basics, and you can personalise it to however you prefer! </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Day-old cooked rice</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Shallots</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Fish Sauce</li>
        <li>Shrimp Paste</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Chilli</li>
        <li>MSG</li>
        <li>Spring Onions</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fry shallots in oil over high heat until super crisp and golden-brown, then transfer it to a bowl with a paper towel to drain off the oil.</li>
        <li>Fry an egg sunny side-up in oil over high heat until the bottom is super crisp, but the yolk is still relatively runny, then set the egg aside.</li>
        <li>Add a bit of oil, then add in your garlic, shrimp paste and chillis until the garlic turns golden-brown.</li>
        <li>Add in your soy sauce and fish sauce, mix all the wonderful flavours together, then toss in your day-old rice.</li>
        <li>Keep the wok moving and make sure to break up the rice. You want the beautiful individual grains to be seen. If you're feeling up to the task, practice your <em>wok hei</em> skills for an additional smokey flavour.</li>
        <li>Right before you finish cooking, add the spring onions in, then serve up on a plate with the fried shallots. Wallah, you've got your fried rice! Simple, isn't it?</li>
    </ol>
